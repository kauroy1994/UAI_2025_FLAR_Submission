Below is an example **README**-style documentation that **walks a user** through **installing and running** your **FLAR** package from **GitHub** using `pip`. You can include this in your repository’s `README.md` (or a separate “installation” doc). Adjust details as needed to match your GitHub repository name, package name, etc.

## FLAR Installation & Usage

### 1. Installation

Cloned the repository locally, and then you can install in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kauroy1994/flar.git
cd flar
pip install -e .
```

Either approach will download and install FLAR along with its dependencies.

---

### 2. Verifying Installation

After installation, you should be able to open a Python interpreter and import FLAR without error:

```python
python
>>> import flar
>>> flar.__version__
'0.1.0' 
```

---

### 3. Basic Usage

Assuming you have observational data in a NumPy array `X_data` of shape `(N, d)`:

```python
import flar
import numpy as np

X_data = np.random.randn(500, 10)  # Example: 500 samples, 10 variables

flar.run_flar_small(X_data, max_iter=3,verbose=True)
flar.run_flar_large(X_data, threshold=0.1, max_iter=5,verbose=True)
```

### 4. Additional Options

FLAR supports hyperparameters for controlling:
- Number of outer iterations (`max_iter`)
- Number of weak learners per variable
- Shrinkage factor
- Lagrangian penalty strength
- Clamping range for adjacency
- Learning rates for adjacency and weak learner nets

For example:

```python
adjacency_est = flar.run_flar(
    X_data,
    threshold=0.2,
    max_iter=5,
    max_num_weak_learners=5,
    hidden_dim=8,
    lambda_h=1.0,
    shrinkage=0.2,
    verbose=True
)
```

Refer to the docstrings inside the FLAR source code for more detailed explanations of each parameter.
