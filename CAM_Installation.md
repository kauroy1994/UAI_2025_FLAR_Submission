To resolve CAM Installation Errors, you can follow these steps:

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Install Required System Dependencies
Some R packages, like `glmnet` and `mboost`, require system-level libraries to compile correctly. Ensure these are installed

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libgfortran5 libxml2-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libgmp3-dev
```

---

### üì¶ Step 2: Install R Dependencies
Install the necessary R packages, specifying a local library path to avoid permission issue:

```bash
R_LIB_PATH="${HOME}/R/libs"
mkdir -p "${R_LIB_PATH}"

Rscript -e "install.packages(c('glmnet', 'mboost'), repos='https://cloud.r-project.org', lib='${R_LIB_PATH}')"
```


---

### üì• Step 3: Install the CAM Package from CRAN Archiv

Since the CAM package is archived, download and install it manualy:


```bash
CAM_VERSION="1.0"
CAM_TARBALL="CAM_${CAM_VERSION}.tar.gz"
CAM_URL="https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/CAM/${CAM_TARBALL}"

wget -q "${CAM_URL}" -O "${CAM_TARBALL}"
Rscript -e "install.packages('${CAM_TARBALL}', repos = NULL, type = 'source', lib='${R_LIB_PATH}')"
rm "${CAM_TARBALL}"
```

---

### üîß Step 4: Configure R to Use the Custom Library Pah

Ensure R recognizes the custom library path by adding it to your `.Renviron` fle:


```bash
echo "R_LIBS_USER='${R_LIB_PATH}'" >> "${HOME}/.Renviron"
```

---

### üêç Step 5: Configure Python to Use the Correct Rscript Pth

In your Python script, specify the path to the Rscript executable to ensure proper integraion

```python
import cdt
cdt.SETTINGS.rpath = "/usr/bin/Rscript"  # Update this path if Rscript is located elsewhere
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Verify Installation

- **In **: Run `library(CAM)` to confirm the CAM package loads without erors.

- **In Pytho**: Attempt to use the CAM functionality through CDT to ensure integration is succesful.
